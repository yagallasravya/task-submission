# Assessment

This repository contains the assessment tasks implemented using React.

Includes:
- 'PortfolioSummary.js' - If node is already installed, we can directly run using `node portfoliosummary.js` else use a online javascript runner
- 'transaction-table' – Renders a transaction table with date, description, and amount.
   `cd transaction-table` and run `npm start` 
- 'account-balance' – Displays account summaries with total balance and a low balance warning.
   `cd transaction-table` and run `npm start`
